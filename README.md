# solution-to-prolog-questions
This are some questions I came across and the solutions I came up with.<br>
All answers are tested and they work!<br>
It's important to note that I'm still learning this language and like any programming question it can have multiple answers, so if you try solving the questions and get 
another answer it's ok!<br>
I will try to include my thought process with each answer.<br>

<h2>Questions:</h2><br>
